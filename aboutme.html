                My name is Arad Afzali. I'm currently a Student at the Sharif
                University of Technology studying Computer Engineering in Iran.
              </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 7px">
                I have a strong interest in technology development which is why
                I enjoy challenging myself in programming and discovering
                solutions. I started to learn programming on my own and after
                that, I took some coding courses online and offline which I
                found them beneficent.
                <br>
                I'm really interested in how technology impacts our lives and the world around us. That's why I enjoy learning about topics like cloud computing, computer networks, AI, IoT, edge computing, HCI, and operating systems. These areas are always evolving and offer exciting possibilities for innovation and collaboration. I like figuring out how they work, how they can get better, and how we can use them to solve real-world problems.
                <br>
                I also really enjoy some hobbies in my spare time. I love taking photos, playing sports like running and swimming, and spending time on video games and watching movies. These hobbies keep me entertained and show me how tech and fun can go hand in hand.
