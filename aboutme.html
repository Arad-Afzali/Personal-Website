                My name is Arad Afzali. I graduated from Sharif University of Technology with a degree in Computer Engineering.

              <p style="padding-bottom: 7px; text-align: justify;">
                I have a strong interest in technology development, especially in cybersecurity. I enjoy challenging myself with programming and discovering solutions to complex problems. I started learning programming on my own and later took several online and offline coding courses, which I found extremely beneficial.
                <br>
                Iâ€™m particularly interested in how technology impacts our lives and the world around us. My primary focus is on cybersecurity, but I also enjoy learning about related topics like cloud computing, computer networks, AI, IoT, edge computing, HCI, and operating systems. These areas are constantly evolving and present exciting opportunities for innovation and collaboration. I like figuring out how they work, how they can be improved, and how they can be used to address real-world challenges.
                <br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy various hobbies. I love photography, playing sports like running and swimming, socializing with friends, and spending time on video games and watching movies. These activities keep me entertained and show me how tech and fun can go hand in hand.
